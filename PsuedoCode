ACTIVITY 1

User Phrase: "My name is John"
Output: "MY NAME IS JOHN"
User can 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY 2
Create an output that asks the user to input 2 numbers: Output: "Please enter 2 Numbers"
Create a boolean or double so that the user can input their 2 different numbers
User is prompted to input: Number 1: 10
User is prompted to input 2nd number: Number 2: 12
Create output that shows what the two numbers combined give you: Output: 22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY 3
Create an output message that asks the user to enter numbers that they would like to add together: Output: "Please enter numbers you want added"
Create the prompt for the user to fill out a number: User Input: Number: 10
Create a message that will show up after the user enters the number that asks if they want to enter another number or not
Output: "Another Number? (Y/N)
If the user types in Y, have the prompt come up again for them to enter another number
User Input: Y
User Input: Number: 20
Output: "Another Number?"
User Input: Y
User Input : 15
Output: "Another Number?"
User Input: N
Show the sum of the numbers the user has entered Output: "45"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY 4
Prompt the user to enter a maximum number, Then make the system print out a random number between 0 and their number and create a loop that will ask the user after input if they want to add another number or not
User Input: Max Number: 100
Output: 11
Call upon the loop you made: Output: New Number?(y/n) 
User enters Y for Yes: User Input: Y
User Input: Max Number: 10
Output: 2
Loop will play again
Ouput: New Number?(y/n) 
User Input:N
Loop Ends

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY 5
Create counter variables for  Left and Right results
Set left_count = 0
Set right_count = 0

Create a loop to repeat the process 10 times
FOR count from 1 to 10
Make a random number generator and make the range from 1 to 100
SET random_number = Random)1,100)

Create a modulo operator to check if the number is even or odd
If random_number MOD 2 == 0
Output: Print "Right"
Set right_count = right_count + 1
ELSE
Output: Print "Left"
Set left_count = left_count + 1
After the process repeats 10 times, the code will end and then have it print out the final counts
